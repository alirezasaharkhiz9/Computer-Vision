# Undergraduate Project - Computer Vision

### Overview

This undergraduate project focuses on exploring and developing advanced techniques in computer vision, structured into two main sections: Classical Computer Vision and Modern Deep Learning-based Computer Vision. The project begins by covering the fundamentals of image processing, video analysis, and classical object detection algorithms. In the second part, using cutting-edge tools like PyTorch, artificial neural networks (ANN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) will be implemented. The project also delves into modern techniques such as transfer learning, pre-trained models, and the emerging Vision Transformers. Furthermore, efficient object detection with YOLO and facial recognition using deep learning will be thoroughly explored.

### Modern CV vs Classical CV

| **Topic**                          | **Classical Computer Vision**                                                | **Modern Computer Vision (Using Deep Learning)**                                                                |
|-----------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Definition and Core Principles** | Based on hand-crafted algorithms and engineered features.                    | Based on deep neural networks and learning from large datasets.                                                 |
| **Feature Extraction Method**      | Features are extracted manually using algorithms like SIFT, SURF, and HOG.   | Features are automatically learned by convolutional neural networks (CNNs).                                     |
| **Accuracy**                       | Accuracy is usually limited and optimization for complex problems is harder. | Generally achieves much higher accuracy, especially in complex tasks like image recognition and classification. |
| **Amount of Data Required**        | Requires less data, but models are usually less optimized.                   | Requires large amounts of data for effective learning.                                                          |
| **Computational Complexity**       | Generally lighter and simpler in computation.                                | Heavier in computation and requires powerful hardware (GPUs).                                                   |
